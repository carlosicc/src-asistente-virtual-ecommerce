He especially enjoys teasing the younger engines who are always devising ways to get back at him. Measuring 28cm in height and built from wood, Cranky features a fully functioning crane mechanism with 2 red levers. The first lever can be used to spin Cranky's head, and the crane, 360 degrees while the second raises and lowers the crane. The hoist utilises a strong magnet which allows Cranky to pick up and move cargo or even engines! Cranky the Crane comes with a goods cargo carriage and his own magnetic cargo for him to move. Cranky and his cargo are compatible with the Thomas Wooden Railway. Encourage imaginative play with the Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway - Cranky the Crane, a great toy for fans of Thomas and Friends. Amazon.co.uk Review Children love Cranky, the slightly testy tempered railway crane, yet too often he's neglected in Thomas toy ranges. So it's wonderful to see Cranky given a starring role as a core accessory for the Thomas the Tank Wooden Railway Set. This Cranky the Crane stands at a height of 28 cm, with a wooden main body and stand. Cranky's real magic comes from his fully functioning crane mechanism. The first of two separate red levers easily enable little railway engineers to rotate Cranky around 360 degrees. The second lever then lowers Cranky's hoist up and down to load and unload the cargo. The loading itself all happens courtesy of an exceptionally strong magnet, the power of which means that Cranky doesn't have to be perfectly positioned beside his cargo for your little engineer to gain job satisfaction. Naturally Cranky the Crane comes complete with his own cargo goods train with magnetic cargo. All of this good clean pulley, lever and magnet fun does of course mean that as well as being a delightful toy, Cranky is a wonderful introduction to the world of early science and working machines. Cranky's body detaches from the crane tower. Beware that to re-install correctly it is important that the two flat-edged grooves of crane tower and body are aligned. This is very easy to do but also easy to overlook and incorrect assembly will stop Cranky functioning properly. A particularly good accessory to any wooden train set, Cranky the Crane combines fun, education and a lovable character to boot. Ideal for children aged 3 to 6 years old. --Victoria Mackenzie","Mum of a Thomas fanatic // 4.0 // 17 Nov. 2003 // By

Date First Available10 Oct. 2011   ","Jaques Chinese Checkers board is a circular board handcrafted from solid wood and features glossy coloured wooden pegs. Dimensions: 8.5' in diameter Chinese checkers is a classic board game for 2, 3, 4 or 6 players. Each player has ten pegs of one colour at one starting point of the star. The objective of the wood game is to occupy the star point directly opposite. The first player to accomplish this is a winner. Of course if in the same round more than one players reach the end point all of them are winners. Each player moves in turn, (in this implementation clockwise). A move consists of placing a peg into one of the adjacent holes or jumping over any other one peg into a hole beyond. The direction of the move has to be one of the following: left/right, forward left/right, backward left/right in a players direction of play. Only one move is made at a time, except when jumping. Then the player can make any number of jumps in any direction as long as all the moves consist of jumps. Players may jump their own or their opponents' pegs. No pegs are removed from the board during play. History Despite its name, the game is not a variation of checkers, nor did it originate in China or any part of Asia (on the other hand, the game known as ""Chinese chess"", or xiangqi, is from China). The game was invented in Germany in 1892 under the name ""Stern-Halma"" as a variation of the older American game Halma.[4] The ""Stern"" (German for star) refers to the board's star shape (in contrast to the square board used in Halma). The name ""Chinese Checkers"" originated in the United States as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The Pressman company's game was originally called ""Hop Ching Checkers"". The game was introduced to Chinese-speaking regions mostly by the Japanese","Best game! // 5.0 // 16 May 2013 // By

They are herbivores and feed on green plants and nuts. Deer live in small groups, usually only the mother and its calves. The males have magnificent antlers and live in small groups of three or four animals. Both the male deer and doe have a red-brown coat in the summer and a grey one in the winter. As they now have almost no natural enemies, deer populations are sometimes so large that they cannot find enough to eat. Deer are ruminant animals like cows, which means they have four stomachs and ruminate half-digested food. This complicated procedure allows the deer to eat twigs for example, which most animals cannot digest. Box Contains 1 x Schleich White-tailed buck","Very realistic! // 5.0 // 8 Dec. 2014 // By

This diminutive Shetland pony, one of Britain's oldest breeds, started out as a working animal. Named for the barren Scottish islands from where he came, this stocky pony is a rugged survivor with a shaggy coat and long mane to protect him from the elements and able to live on very little fodder.Docile and intelligent, yet incredibly strong for his size, the Shetland stands between about 7 and 11 hands, comes in a range of colours (with black and dark brown being the most common) and sports a short neck, small dished face, wide set eyes and tiny, alert ears.Is it the toss of a flowing mane?The prance of their step?Or the seemingly unlimited depths of their eyes? Breyer model horses are a triumph of artistry and refinement, capturing the indefinable presence and unique features that distinguish the spirit and personality of the real horse. Scuplted by talented equestrian artists, individually painted by hand and carefully detailed, Breyer models are without equal in authenticity and artistry. Whether a portrait model of a famous horse or accomplished champion, Breyer models are destined to become a centrepiece of a collection that will last an entire lifetime.When artistry is everything, it has to be a Breyer model horse.

This box contains a set of 72 bright and colourful high-quality memory® picture cards. The cards feature lots of different images of your favourite fashion doll - Barbie. There are 36 different pairs to match up and collect in this classic family favourite game. Place the cards randomly face down on the floor or table. It helps if the cards are placed in neat rows. Players take turns turning over only two cards at a time. If the cards match, the pair can be collected. Should the cards not match, they must be turned face down again and play continues in a clockwise direction to the next player. The aim is to try and remember where the cards are, as this will help players find matching pairs on their next turn. The player with the most pairs, when all the cards have been collected, is the winner. The game play can be varied to suit different ages and abilities; for younger children use fewer cards, but you’ll be surprised at just how good youngsters are at this game – there is every chance that as their skills develop they will beat you! The memory® cards are made from sturdy high-quality card, laminated on both sides with a colour print. Each card measures approximately 6 x 6cm.

The two-piece set made of high-quality plastic shell mould meets the needs of game wishes of small sunbathers. Each of the large shell halves can be easily filled with sand or water and provides plenty of room for endless game enjoyment. So every garden is transformed into a beautiful resort. The 2-piece is suitable for wintering or transport. Clean sand and water mussel, cleaned easily and folded simply and compact. The BIG SAND/WATER SHELL is available in blue and green colours. Important. To protect children from choking, the shell halves are in accordance with standard designed that they are not closed in an air and watertight manner. Due to the unevenness of the two bearing surfaces, a circumferential surface is adequate ventilation for the closure of the shell. We therefore recommend that you cover the shell after the game with the BIG-Sandpit cover to protect against contamination and moisture.","flimsy! // 2.0 // 30 Aug. 2013 // By

The Gran Turismo body shape was aerodynamically optimised and resulted in a perfect combination of suitability for purpose and beauty. The front of the 250 GTO was particularly attractive due to the three cooling vents for the 2953 cc engine. The 250 stood for the capacity of one of the 12 engine cylinders, the O for omologato (= type approved), the FIA approval for races in the GT class. The GTO was shown for the first time in 1962. Thanks to its 300 hp engine and good aerodynamics it achieved a speed of about 280 km/h with acceleration from 0 to 100 in just 5.6 seconds. For three whole years (1962, 1963 and 1964) the GTO dominated its racing class in inimitable style.

Manufactured by the Daimler Company in Coventry, it was the last car to be launched by Daimler before its parent company sold the marque to Jaguar Cars in 1960. Originally described as a 2 + 2 sports car, it came with a fibreglass body, either a 4-speed manual or 3-speed automatic gearbox and fitted with a 2.5 litre iron-block V-8 140 hp engine. Around thirty black SP250s were used by the Traffic Department of London's Metropolitan Police, primarily to catch speeding motorists. The Police vehicles were fitted with the automatic gearbox option, considered more suitable for round the clock urban use, which also extended to some vehicles being used by the traffic police in other major counties in the UK. Our replica SP250 is painted in a gloss black with beige hood in the upright position. The interior is dark orange with a beige floor and the model is registered 550 CLU. Several refinements from the standard vehicle were required for specific Police use and they have all been incorporated into our authentic model. They include bumpers without over-riders and single spotlight mounted on the front bumper. Additional interior fittings include a radio, speedometer, an additional mirror, raised roof component, automatic transmission gear stick, printed interior door handles and window winder handle and a single driver's side wing mounted mirror. Traffic duties must never have felt so good for the Police team behind the wheel of this little gem! It will also be an interesting addition for those collectors specialising in this model category.","Five Stars // 5.0 // 6 Jan. 2016 // By

Consequently in January 1940 the General Ship Board responsible for these plans decided that a new destroyer should be designed with a 127 mm main armament in five gun turrets and 10 torpedo tubes. By the end of 1940 orders for 100 ships of the future Fletcher Class were placed with 11 different shipyards. When the USA came into the war in December 1941, the navy placed a further 75 orders. TheDD-445 USS Fletcher type called after Admiral Frank F. Fletcher was launched on 3rd May 1942 from Federal Shipbuilding in Kearny, New Jersey. Unlike previous USdestroyers the hull of the ship was able to withstand much heavier loads, so that the destroyer driven by two high-pressure steam turbines with a capacity of60,000 shp reached a top speed of 37 knots. The maximum cruising speed under operational conditions was 32 to 33 knots. Modern radar equipment ensured that she was also fully operational by night and in poor visibility. Some parts of the superstructure were clad in 12 mm hardened steel armour increased to as muchas 19 mm armour plating in vital areas of the hull. Thanks to a very conservative construction, a powerful power plant and extensive modern radar andsensor systems, the ships of the Fletcher Class proved to be the most successfulUS Navy destroyers in the 2nd World War. During the war 18 ships were lost due to enemy action mainly in the Pacific. Shortly after the war ended 145 Fletcher destroyers were retired from service. At the beginning of the Korean War the US Navy reactivated over 60 ships and at the end of the 1950s some were sold to allies.

The JS-2, which was put into production in December 1943 during the latter half of WWII, had a long powerful 122mm gun and superior armor. From August, 1944 the hatch on the front glacis was deleted, which greatly improved its frontal protection. The JS-2 was produced in the Chelyabinsk Kirov factory (ChKZ), and they proved to be effective as 'breakthrough' tanks as well as combating German armor. The Tamiya 1/48 scale model kit faithfully captures the details of this iconic World War II machine.","Four Stars // 4.0 // 23 Aug. 2015 // By

In Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Trivia Game, you will be asked, ""Who are the keepers of Gringotts?"", ""What happened to Professor Quirrell in the Black Forest?"" and hundreds of other such questions. If you and your clan think you can answer these, then this superb game is the perfect antidote to the between-instalment blues. Based on the first book in JK Rowling's bestselling, award-winning series Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone, the game combines all the best elements of a trivia game with a superstar touch (and lets face it, there aren't many superstar wizards on the planet) that will have endless appeal for true Harry lovers. The object of the game is to be the first player to collect six different ""Charm Cards"" by answering Potteresque trivia questions correctly. You then race to your chosen Hogwarts house and answer one final question to win the game. The trivia format of the game is familiar, but the clever twists that bring the intrinsic ""Harry-ness"" to life add a certain spice and will keep young book-lovers happy for hours. The game is beautifully designed and packaged--the game board is stunningly and intricately illustrated, and includes collectible ""Charm Cards"" which feature items from the original book--and the questions are tricky enough to tax the grey cells of even the smartest fan. The gaming level can be altered according to age, ability and knowledge of Harry's world, so no-one needs to feel excluded. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone Trivia Game is a classy piece of HP merchandise, perfect for families to enjoy together, and is worth every penny for the Harry fan in your life.

 on 7 Feb. 2006 // This is an excelltent game for anyone who has read the first harry potter book. I have now had it for at least five years and I still get asked new questions everytime we play!  Just one nag though. MAKE IT FOR THE OTHER BOOKS!!! I agree with an earlier rewiewer who said that the manufacturers should just make other sets of cards for the other books but just keep the same gameboard. This would the turn from an excellent game to a superb game. BUY IT NOW! WELL WORTH THE MONEYFun-*****  Very fun for all agesDurability",Harry Potter,Toys,,,Characters & Brands

But sometimes, the greatest threat is from those that you trust, and in the latest Harry Potter movie, the Ministry of Magic are just as challenging as the dark wizards. But, ever resourceful, Harry Potter and his friends form a secret alliance and uncover a chilling prophecy. Join new characters such as Luna Lovegood and Bellatrix Lestrange and old favourites such as Ron and Hermione. Harry and his pals (and enemies) are rated on categories including Magic, Cunning, Courage, Wisdom and Temper. This pack can be played with Harry potter and The Goblet of Fire for an extra special Top Trumps Treat.Top Trumps has been played since the 1970s when the first packs took the playgrounds of the UK by storm. And its success is partly due to how easy and compelling it is to play: shuffle and deal all the cards face down. Each player takes their cards and holds them so that they can see the top card only. The player to the dealer's left starts by reading out a selected statistic (e.g. Weight or Speed). The other players then read out the same statistic from their own top cards. The player with the best or highest value wins and places all the top cards including their own to the bottom of their own pile. It is then that player's turn to choose a statistic from the next card. If two or more cards share the top value or data is unavailable for that statistic, then all the top cards are placed in the middle and the same player chooses from the next card. The winner of that hand takes all the cards from the middle as well. The person with all the cards at the end is the winner, easy. Classic.","Flim 3 // 5.0 // 25 Nov. 2009 // By

Whether used for war or commerce, they were generally armed with cannons. The galleon was an evolution of the caravel and carrack. A lowering of the forecastle and elongation of the hull gave an unprecedented level of stability in the water, and reduced wind resistance at the front, leading to a faster, more maneuverable vessel. The galleon was powered entirely by sail, carried on three to five masts, with a lateen sail continuing to be used on the last (usually third) mast.","Great pirate ship my friends little boy loved it we ... // 5.0 // 26 Aug. 2014 // By

Le Matin asked in 1907. The challenge was eventually taken up by five teams including an Italian nobleman, a dastardly con man and a journalist from The Daily Telegraph. Crossing 12,000 miles of the most inhospitable terrain, without maps, all but one team made it to the finishing line. Now, a century after that historic race pushed cars and their owners to the limit, the rally was re-run in 2007. Among 134 vintage cars that departed from the Great Wall of China were some of the same models that competed in the first race in 1907, with top speeds of just 35mph. Matthew and John Keeler of Reading, Berkshire, UK entered a 1959 Volkswagen Beetle which was prepared with a twin air cleaner in light of the Gobi desert conditions that they will be facing and uprated suspension and modifications based on the East Africa Safari Rally VW's of the 60's, along with knowledge gained from other Classic Car Rallies and Trials set-up on Beetles.The Volkswagen Type 1, widely known as the Volkswagen Beetle or Volkswagen Bug, is an economy car produced by the German auto maker Volkswagen (VW) from 1938 until 2003. With over 21 million manufactured in an air-cooled, rear engine, rear-wheel drive configuration, the Beetle is the longest-running and most-manufactured automobile of a single design platform anywhere in the world.'GROLLE' History:'Grolle' originally came from Sweden. Discovered in a barn in Kent, England, Grolle went to VW restoration company Henley Beetles for a complete strip down and rebuild. A few modifications were made for the rally ahead. These included: a roll cage, under body skid plate protection, an engine and gearbox rebuild, Kubelwagen drain plugs in the floor (for river crossings), front beam strengtheners and heavy duty shock absorbers. The car had strengthened wheel arches and tyres with reinforced sidewalls. The look of the car was based on the Swedish 1960’s Scania Vabis VW’s.This car features digital plug ready (DPR) chassis, quick-change braid plate, working lights and Magnatraction with alternate magnet positions for driver choice.Convert to Scalextric Digital in 30 seconds with the C8515 Digital Chip.

II"" and the answer certainly won't be 50-50: they'll love it. Based on the hit TV show that has pulled record audience figures around the world, the game is much as it is onscreen: you must answer increasingly difficult general knowledge questions in sequence, without getting any wrong, to win larger and larger amounts of money (in this case, fictional cash!). You have three lifelines, 50-50, Ask the Audience and even Phone A Friend, but once they're gone you're on your own. The questions in this new version have been updated, so even addicted players of the first edition will have plenty to go at. Cards replace Chris Tarrant and a board replaces the TV studio, but otherwise the atmosphere can be every bit as electric as the real thing. So go on, give it a try. You may just be the next paper Millionaire! --Sophie Lowe Each of these games contains a ""golden ticket"", giving the holder a chance to win a visit to the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" studio to meet Chris Tarrant and play the game for real.","Brilliant // 4.0 // 10 Sept. 2001 // By

They celebrate Falcon's distinctive brand values of heritage and innovation. We choose only the most suitable illustrations and photographs for our jigsaws. We die-cut each jigsaw piece carefully, so when the jigsaw is completed, it looks more like a poster than a puzzle. Making jigsaws has always been, and will always remain, our passion.

But use the 216 high quality plastic puzzle pieces contained in this set, and construction can be completed in no time at all! You can either assemble your building “by eye” (using the printed design representing the carved stonework), or you may prefer to refer to the reference numbers printed on the reverse side of the pieces. Put the pieces together in sequence and see this amazing bell tower appear before your eyes (it even ""leans"" like the original!). This would make an excellent pastime or gift for someone interested in architecture or tourism, a lovely memento of a visit to Pisa and may appeal to traditional puzzle fans after a new challenge. We reckon it might just appeal to those who enjoy model railways too … a really unusual way to introduce substantial international 3D buildings to an existing set up.

TOP 1000 REVIEWER on 27 Aug. 2012 // I've become a big fan of the Ravensburger 3D landmark series and have bought most of them by now, and will probably keep on going.Unlike the Big Ben and Eiffel Tower models, the Leaning Tower of Pisa has no hinged pieces, and is made up entirely of curved pieces. It's a lot easier to put together, maybe the easiest of the set, but it is also the one that works best as a traditional jigsaw - i.e. judging what goes where by the pattern rather than by the numbers on the back of the pie",Ravensburger,,,,Characters & Brands

The patented mechanical toy flies by flapping its tear-proof wings up to 50metres, powered by a high quality rubber band and mechanism. Simply pull the lever under the right wing, hold the bird upside down and turn the handle 50 times. Lift the tail and adjust the angle to achieve the desired flight direction, this enables the bird to climb and turn. Finally press the switch under the right wing, once the wings begin to flap, gently launch the bird into the wind but do not throw. Designed in France in 1969 by Gérard De Ruymbeke, this patented flying bird is an ornithopter. From the Greek words ornithos “bird” and pteron “wing”, an ornithopter is any aircraft that flies by flapping its wings. Birds were the inspiration to Leonardo da Vinci when he designed an ornithopter in 1490. He never saw the ornithopter fly however, because it was heavy and required too much energy to produce lift and thrust. In 1929 a human-powered ornithopter, constructed by Alexander Lippisch, was towed into the air and glided. The first toy ornithopter was sold in Paris in 1879. Brainstorm Toys is a range of fun, educational and interactive toys that brings together a host of fascinating items. The aim of Brainstorm Toys branded products is to entertain children but also inspire them to learn more about their environment.

We have cows and sheep and yes, the funny hens. We have a big, cuddly dog too, called Patch. Patch is very clever. I think he might be the cleverest dog ever born. Do you have a dog? After school, I love to go to the playground. My Nana always brings me. Sometimes, she even swings with me and goes really high. That makes us laugh out loud. She hasn’t tried the zip-line yet though, but I keep asking her to. Do you have a ‘super-gran’ like me? I’m so glad you and I are going to be friends”.","Five Stars // 5.0 // 20 Aug. 2015 // By

The Archangel is a thoroughbred air-to-air interceptor, designed solely for air superiority missions. It is a small aircraft, built around a pair of conventional ?Retribution? 40mm cannons, leading to the moniker ?The Last Gunfighter?. These are devastating at close range and feature low energy consumption, freeing the power needed to close distance and dogfight with lethal poise. The Archangel?s best protection is its excellent manoeuvrability and high speed, since it features only light armour. However, its low cost also ensures that wingmen will never be far away, providing safety in numbers. The Archangel can also be pressed into service for ground attack operations when the need arises, as its cannons are just as deadly against lightly armoured vehicles. This makes it the nemesis of isolated scout units, exposed to attack by prowling packs of these wolves of the sky.

Also these products are cheap! As I said in my Sherman review if this were made by Lego you'd be paying £40 - £50 more in my opinion.

Sort recycling and trash, and match animals with their favorite food and habitat. Splash onto the scene with Gil, Molly, and the Bubble Guppies for a fun-filled learning adventure. There's a spot for you on three field trips and the gang needs your help – soaking up science and social studies subjects while boosting listening comprehension skills are all in a day's work. This innovative LeapFrog Explorer learning game features five curricular minigames, three bonus games, and three activities – every level of play is brimming with new discoveries. Works with LeapPad1, LeapPad2, Leapster Explorer, and LeapsterGS systems (sold separately). Learning skills Experience the excitement of visiting new places and meeting new people! Imagine all there is to learn when you dive into a new destination – the Bubble Guppies have new words and revelations to share with those who play along. Join Molly, Gil, Bubble Puppy, and Mr. Grouper on three exciting field trips – to Bubble City to learn about recycling, to a Dinosaur Dig to pick up fossil facts, and to the Puppy Park to discover an animal habitat. Begin to categorise animals by species and pick up fun facts related to their diets and habitats. Learn about dinosaurs, their physical characteristics, and recognise that fossils reveal secrets about ancient life forms. Finally, learn about the benefits of recycling and conserving resources. This game helps build listening comprehension skills and is appropriate for children aged 3 to 5 years old. The LeapFrog difference LeapFrog has created a learning and play environment that is developmentally appropriate for the target age group. Children interact with screen-based games in ways all their own. Game functionality has been customised to include nursery age-friendly landscape orientation and intuitive horizontal scrolling, generous 'tap and touch' hot spots to accommodate developing fine motor skills, visually compelling and distinct interactive elements, and the delivery of instantaneous feedback with any child-screen interaction. Studies have shown the benefits of integrating content area learning and literacy learning – science and social studies topics provide natural contexts for building listening comprehension skills. Innovative learning approach Children can be a part of the Bubble Guppies learning environment, discovering social studies and science topics while nurturing their natural curiosity and inquisitiveness. Along the way, children build vocabulary and listening comprehension skills key to early reading as they learn about recycling, animal habitats, fossils, and people and places in the community.

The Dear Zoo Dominoes are a great game for both pre-school girls and boys aged three upwards. Cracking for Christmas and brilliant for birthdays, these bright and colourful dominoes will keep children entertained for hours whilst helping the development of hand-eye coordination, matching and organisation skills. Each of the cheerfully illustrated dominoes features characters from Rod Campbell's classic lift-flap storybook loved by children for more than three decades now. Any child who has read Dear Zoo will love the story of how a child writes to the zoo asking for a pet. A series of unsuitable pets are dispatched until the last page when the perfect pet arrives. From two swinging monkeys and six grey elephants to two lions and five slithering snakes, each domino features two sets of animals on a bold coloured background ready for pre-school matching fun. Dear Zoo Dominoes are great way to encourage your child to interact and communicate with whoever they're playing with. They'll also learn to negotiate rules, take turns and problem solves - all whilst having fun with the educational and entertaining Dear Zoo Dominoes!

 on 23 Sept. 2012 // Very family orientated game. You don't need to have a particular strength or weakness to play and enjoy this game. We tend to have gatherings of 9 or 10 people and this is perfect entertainment. Age or gender is irrelevant. Makes a change from Monopoly! The only slight drawback is the price, which I think a lot of people might find too expensive. | Good Game // 3.0 // 19 Nov. 2013 // By

 on 19 Jan. 2016 // I'm not a fan of drinking from plastic vessels (particularly alcohol) and the quality of these novelty folding glasses is usually poor. However though the actual 'glass' could be stronger grade plastic this is an above average version of the concept.  The translucent folding glass comes supplied in a sturdy translucent cub complete with a bottle opener mounted in the lid. Handy little gadget.
