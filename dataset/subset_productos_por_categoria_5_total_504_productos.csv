This Edward engine has been made from real wood and comes with a coal tender carriage. The carriage, and other Thomas Wooden Railway engines, can be connected together using a strong magnetic coupling system found on the front and back of the engines. This Edward engine has a printed name on the chassis and includes a character card which outlines Edward's personality and role within Sodor. The Thomas & Friends Wooden Railway - Edward the Blue Engine is a great way to encourage roleplay. Amazon.co.uk Review Edward the Blue Engine is an older engine. Kind and patient with Thomas and the other younger engines, Edward is a Really Useful Engine. This Edward is made out of real wood and arrives complete with his own coal truck. He has a three-dimensional face and is linked to his own coal truck with a very strong magnetic coupling. Over the years (and these Thomas trains will have years of play value) these solid wooden trains will prove to be a great investment as they stand the test of time.

 on 13 Aug. 2015 // This is a product review for the Jim Henson’s Dinosaur Train Mr. Conductor figure made by TOMY. The figure comes nicely packaged which is colourful and easy to open and release the figure from.  Mr. Conductor stands just shy of 8 inches.Sculpt: The figure is very accurate to the tv show character; it’s immediately recognisable. The materials are mostly plastic but the arms are rubber, being the thinnest part of the toy this is just as well to prevent snapped limbs.  The figure lacks in texture being just gloss",Tomy,,,,Characters & Brands,14.99

Date First Available10 Oct. 2011   ","Jaques Chinese Checkers board is a circular board handcrafted from solid wood and features glossy coloured wooden pegs. Dimensions: 8.5' in diameter Chinese checkers is a classic board game for 2, 3, 4 or 6 players. Each player has ten pegs of one colour at one starting point of the star. The objective of the wood game is to occupy the star point directly opposite. The first player to accomplish this is a winner. Of course if in the same round more than one players reach the end point all of them are winners. Each player moves in turn, (in this implementation clockwise). A move consists of placing a peg into one of the adjacent holes or jumping over any other one peg into a hole beyond. The direction of the move has to be one of the following: left/right, forward left/right, backward left/right in a players direction of play. Only one move is made at a time, except when jumping. Then the player can make any number of jumps in any direction as long as all the moves consist of jumps. Players may jump their own or their opponents' pegs. No pegs are removed from the board during play. History Despite its name, the game is not a variation of checkers, nor did it originate in China or any part of Asia (on the other hand, the game known as ""Chinese chess"", or xiangqi, is from China). The game was invented in Germany in 1892 under the name ""Stern-Halma"" as a variation of the older American game Halma.[4] The ""Stern"" (German for star) refers to the board's star shape (in contrast to the square board used in Halma). The name ""Chinese Checkers"" originated in the United States as a marketing scheme by Bill and Jack Pressman in 1928. The Pressman company's game was originally called ""Hop Ching Checkers"". The game was introduced to Chinese-speaking regions mostly by the Japanese","Best game! // 5.0 // 16 May 2013 // By

There isn't a lot of flashing to worry about on the sprues and, as long as full attention is given to the instruction sheet, this will produce a very good finished kit.Based on the lower cost alone, I would recommend this kit to anyone who wants a larger scale version than the 1:48 scale avai",Model Building Kits,Tanks,,,Hobbies,13.63

He stands an imposing 29 cm (12 inches high) in his army boots. He's dressed ready for armed jungle combat in moulded plastic khaki vest with Action Man logo and camouflage combat trousers that fasten with Velcro (for when he gets caught short whilst in a foxhole, presumably). He even has an authentic metal dog-tag, and the obligatory out-all-night stubble and facial scar received during an earlier mission. In the best Action Man tradition, he's armed to the teeth, ready for a surprise attack. He has a deadly looking machete (which parents will be relieved to hear is actually totally harmless on account of it being completely blunt). The best fun of all is his missile launcher that can fire a plastic missile (also completely blunt) when you press the tattoo on his left bicep. The missile launcher has a range of approximately six feet, ideal for a sortie over next door's fence. Because of small parts, Operation Jungle Action Man is not suitable for children under three years of age. --Alison Drury","An excellent toy..

Building the stunning replica of Hogwarts Castle was challenging and exciting and resulted in several hours of silence and unprecedented concentration. The stunning, unexpected details were impressive: trap doors, secret stairways, moving portraits, treasure chests, a working magnifying glass, an impressive holographic sticker, a glow-in-the-dark Voldemort and a Hagrid who, in comparison to the other figures, was a perfectly proportioned giant. The basic instructions were easy to follow and the castle can be built in many different ways, allowing children to use their imaginations and recreate scenes from the books. This is a sure-fire winner for any Harry Potter fan, and indeed for any LEGO fan. The Gryffindor Dormitory set and the Chamber of the Winged Keys are less difficult to build and would make great presents, particularly for younger Harry Potter fans, but when combined with the Hogwarts Castle set they add new dimensions to the scene. For once it seems that movie merchandise has really hit the spot. Age 7 (and a half!) and over. Susan Harrison See all Product Description","It's wonderful! // 5.0 // 23 Oct. 2001 // By

Spider webs cover Harry's wizarding robes to distinguish him from the basic Chamber of Secrets Harry figure. Each figure in the series comes with a different color Slime compound, intended to be poured over the figure, in keeping with the theme of the Basilisk, a massive snake that appears in the film. The figures can also be used with the Slime Chamber Playset.

Whether used for war or commerce, they were generally armed with cannons. The galleon was an evolution of the caravel and carrack. A lowering of the forecastle and elongation of the hull gave an unprecedented level of stability in the water, and reduced wind resistance at the front, leading to a faster, more maneuverable vessel. The galleon was powered entirely by sail, carried on three to five masts, with a lateen sail continuing to be used on the last (usually third) mast.","Great pirate ship my friends little boy loved it we ... // 5.0 // 26 Aug. 2014 // By

This increases collectability, because only the cards in this product will be available with this new pattern. The rares in this set will have black foil names, the same as Battle Pack 1. The big set size as well as the parallel rares together with the low price provides a big incentive for repeat purchase. The set is designed with Sealed Pack play in mind (example of sealed format with the Battle Pack: 8 packs mean a card pool of 40 cards, the player builds a 20 card deck out of this card pool). All cards in the set are chosen specifically for their usability in this format. For example this means that cards that have specific requirements so that they can be played are not included.It also means that some cards that are on the Forbidden List for normal tournament play are included in the set. This offers players a chance to get their hands on these otherwise unavailable cards and play with them in a fun environment. The Battle Pack contains some powerful tournament level cards that are in high demand at the moment. Size: W: 14.5cm L: 12cm H: 4.5cm Weight: 0.34kg For ages 6+ Box Contains 36 x Yu-Gi-Oh!

II"" and the answer certainly won't be 50-50: they'll love it. Based on the hit TV show that has pulled record audience figures around the world, the game is much as it is onscreen: you must answer increasingly difficult general knowledge questions in sequence, without getting any wrong, to win larger and larger amounts of money (in this case, fictional cash!). You have three lifelines, 50-50, Ask the Audience and even Phone A Friend, but once they're gone you're on your own. The questions in this new version have been updated, so even addicted players of the first edition will have plenty to go at. Cards replace Chris Tarrant and a board replaces the TV studio, but otherwise the atmosphere can be every bit as electric as the real thing. So go on, give it a try. You may just be the next paper Millionaire! --Sophie Lowe Each of these games contains a ""golden ticket"", giving the holder a chance to win a visit to the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" studio to meet Chris Tarrant and play the game for real.","Brilliant // 4.0 // 10 Sept. 2001 // By

Today, Thunderbirds remains one of the most influential British Sci-Fi TV shows of its era with its fantastic display of ground-breaking action and adventure in every episode.The puzzle image features eighteen different images that have been taking from the show and displayed in a montage display. You can enjoy piecing together the popular characters that include Lady Penelope Creigton-Ward, Jeff Tracy, brains, Alan, Vergil, Scott and John Tracey and many more. The popular Thunderbrids rescue vehicles are also included in a selection of photographs as well as some highly detailed scenes that you may remember from the original series.The finished size of the 1000 piece puzzle measures 68 x 49cm (approximately) and has been produced using a high quality cardboard to ensure every jigsaw piece maintains its original shape time and time again.Today's Falcon de luxe puzzles are designed and crafted with the same passion for excellence that we have always had. They celebrate Falcon's distinctive brand values of heritage and innovation. We choose only the most suitable illustrations and photographs for our jigsaws. We die-cut each jigsaw piece carefully, so when the jigsaw is completed, it looks more like a poster than a puzzle. Making jigsaws has always been, and will always remain, our passion.

This is the smallest size of Jigboard. The boards are light and portable. If you haven't got a table that you can continuously devote to your jigsaws or you want to be able to move them from place to place in your home then a Jigboard might be the answer to your prayers. Jigboards take the best features of many different styles of jigsaw board and combine them together to make the ULTIMATE puzzle board. They are of rigid construction and completely covered in a special soft fabric that makes them a joy to work with. The fact that the board is rigid means that you can place it on the smallest coffee table and still be able to construct large puzzles without any hassle. Alternatively, a Jigboard can be rested on top of your best dining table or any other shiny surface without the least fear of scratching. The fabric covering keeps the pieces attached to the surface and this, combined with a raised edge around the outside of the board, ensures that individual pieces are never lost. Jigboards can easily be picked up and moved. Furthermore they are light enough to rest on your knee or to make jigsaws in bed. Each board comes complete with a Jigmat that combines together two different materials. One side is the same soft fabric material that covers the board whilst the other side is waterproof plastic. Ordinarily, the Jigmat (plastic side up) completely covers the jigsaw when it is not being worked-on and thus protects the jigsaw puzzle from dust, spillages and the unwanted attention of pets! However, some people prefer to use the Jigmat (flock side up) to store additional loose pieces.","Really sturdy // 5.0 // 7 Dec. 2011 // By

It was quite awkward to put together and to get it to stay together is impossible. It falls to bits every time my daughter plays with it.

Either way, the object of the game is to fill your trolley with as many items as you can from your shopping list. To play, each player chooses a trolley and a shopping list. All 16 item cards are placed on the table, face down. Each player takes it in turn to pick up a card. If the card matches one of the items in the player's shopping list, they keep the card and place it in their trolley. If the item on the card does not appear on their list, it is placed face down back in the same place on the table. Play continues until one player fills their trolley with all the items on their list. The game can be played with just 2 players, but this can be increased to 4 players if used in conjunction with the Fruit and Veg Booster Pack, or with 6 players if used with the original Shopping List game. The game is made with strong, recycled board and is suitable for children aged 3 to 7. It will also help expand children's vocabulary, as there is plenty of opportunity to talk about the items on the cards; what colours things are, what they are made of, what sort of weather would you wear them in. 'Shopping List' is our best-selling game, and the Booster Pack allows you fill your trolley with many more items.","Great addition to the original game // 5.0 // 10 Feb. 2010 // By

 on 10 Feb. 2010 // I found this to be an excellent extra to the original game, which can become quite dull with just the four shopping lists - maybe more for the parent than the child!  This set includes two new shopping lists and two trollies.  It makes the game longer, to have more variety of cards to turn over before finding the right ones, and it means that more people can play if they wish.

Each round takes 10 seconds so all players are involved. A game lasts as long as you want it to, 10 minutes is the norm, but playing for 5 minutes is great fun also. BrainBox is educational and is perfect for families and groups of friends to play, wherever they are, on a level-playing field. Packed in a sturdy cool magnetic cube box. BrainBox is ready to play without any set-up time needed. The rules are pretty straight forward. You can play solo or with as many people as you want. A player simply picks a card and studies it for 10 seconds before being asked a question from the back, chosen by the roll of a die. A correct answer means the card is kept, if not it is returned to the box. The player with most cards after 5 or 10 minutes wins! The winner may not be who you expect as this fabulous game is about observation and memory, not learned facts! BrainBox Inventions contains 55 cards with the most amazing and simple inventions.

That'll make your life a LOT easier.The build was easy enough: being my first time I of course made a couple of mistakes - I flipped the arm around (no biggie), but I also accidentally cut a clip off. Thankfully superglue fixed that.One thing I noticed is that the knives are damaged on the edges you clip them ",Military,,,,Figures & Playsets,14.99

Sort recycling and trash, and match animals with their favorite food and habitat. Splash onto the scene with Gil, Molly, and the Bubble Guppies for a fun-filled learning adventure. There's a spot for you on three field trips and the gang needs your help – soaking up science and social studies subjects while boosting listening comprehension skills are all in a day's work. This innovative LeapFrog Explorer learning game features five curricular minigames, three bonus games, and three activities – every level of play is brimming with new discoveries. Works with LeapPad1, LeapPad2, Leapster Explorer, and LeapsterGS systems (sold separately). Learning skills Experience the excitement of visiting new places and meeting new people! Imagine all there is to learn when you dive into a new destination – the Bubble Guppies have new words and revelations to share with those who play along. Join Molly, Gil, Bubble Puppy, and Mr. Grouper on three exciting field trips – to Bubble City to learn about recycling, to a Dinosaur Dig to pick up fossil facts, and to the Puppy Park to discover an animal habitat. Begin to categorise animals by species and pick up fun facts related to their diets and habitats. Learn about dinosaurs, their physical characteristics, and recognise that fossils reveal secrets about ancient life forms. Finally, learn about the benefits of recycling and conserving resources. This game helps build listening comprehension skills and is appropriate for children aged 3 to 5 years old. The LeapFrog difference LeapFrog has created a learning and play environment that is developmentally appropriate for the target age group. Children interact with screen-based games in ways all their own. Game functionality has been customised to include nursery age-friendly landscape orientation and intuitive horizontal scrolling, generous 'tap and touch' hot spots to accommodate developing fine motor skills, visually compelling and distinct interactive elements, and the delivery of instantaneous feedback with any child-screen interaction. Studies have shown the benefits of integrating content area learning and literacy learning – science and social studies topics provide natural contexts for building listening comprehension skills. Innovative learning approach Children can be a part of the Bubble Guppies learning environment, discovering social studies and science topics while nurturing their natural curiosity and inquisitiveness. Along the way, children build vocabulary and listening comprehension skills key to early reading as they learn about recycling, animal habitats, fossils, and people and places in the community.

This is far more than an introduction to a whole new way of looking at the shell game, and a new system for performing the game that is rock solid, unassailable, and easy to learn. In this, the first installment of a series of DVD's on the shell game, the beginning student is taught an entertaining beginning routine with patter, the basic moves and approaches to the game that make up the system, and given everything necessary to move from a complete beginner to an intermediary proficiency in the shell game.
