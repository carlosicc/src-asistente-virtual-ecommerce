This glitter is also perfect for the glittering of glasses bottles etc as it contains no crushed glass and is fully certified for use in the UK.

For example the Copper colour we have is a very rich deep copper which is almost red.

The colours are nice and my girls were very excited when they saw them.  The only downside is that they are quite chunky to hold and although the kids can't forget to  out the lid on they can forget to twist them back down!

II"" and the answer certainly won't be 50-50: they'll love it. Based on the hit TV show that has pulled record audience figures around the world, the game is much as it is onscreen: you must answer increasingly difficult general knowledge questions in sequence, without getting any wrong, to win larger and larger amounts of money (in this case, fictional cash!). You have three lifelines, 50-50, Ask the Audience and even Phone A Friend, but once they're gone you're on your own. The questions in this new version have been updated, so even addicted players of the first edition will have plenty to go at. Cards replace Chris Tarrant and a board replaces the TV studio, but otherwise the atmosphere can be every bit as electric as the real thing. So go on, give it a try. You may just be the next paper Millionaire! --Sophie Lowe Each of these games contains a ""golden ticket"", giving the holder a chance to win a visit to the ""Who Wants to be a Millionaire"" studio to meet Chris Tarrant and play the game for real.","Brilliant // 4.0 // 10 Sept. 2001 // By

However, it fits together well, the likenesses are excellent and although the paiting might be difficult at times (Martha's patterned vest, the Doctor's pin-striped suit), it's a very accurate and pleasing kit to make.
